        <p><strong>KIMS/FL.A/45</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr. Edwin Ampah</strong><br/><strong>The SRC President</strong> <br/><strong>KIMS</strong><br/> <strong>ACCRA</strong><br/> 13th July 2011</p>
        <p>Dear Mr. Ampah:</p>
        <p><strong>INCLUSION OF A STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE ON DISCIPLINARY<br/>COMMITTEE</strong></p>
        <p>In the past committees investigating examination malpractices have not included student<br/>membership. In the audit report of the Quality Assurance Committee of the National<br/>Accreditation Board on KIMS admissions and examinations, attention has been drawn to this<br/> omission.</p>
        <p>We are therefore writing officially, to inform you that henceforth committees investigating <br/>examination malpractices will include student representative. </p>
        <p>Currently, an ad hoc committee has been constituted to investigate examination malpractices<br/> on Friday, the 22nd July, 2011 at 10:00am at the Conference Hall. We are by a copy of this<br/> letter informing the Chairman of the Committee of your inclusion.</p>
        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
        <p>(signed)</p>
        <p><strong>KOFI ANDOH <br/>(ASSISTANT REGISTRAR)</strong></p>
        <p>Cc:<br/>The President<br/> The Registrar <br/>The Dean of Students<sup>'</sup> Affairs<br/> The Chairman, Examination Disciplinary Committee</p>
